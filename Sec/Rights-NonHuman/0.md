Ti=Section 2. Non-human Rights on Mars

1.Ti=Article 1: Animal Rights

1.1.0.sec=“Animals” refers to living organisms with sense organs and the ability to respond and interact with their environments:

1.1.1.sec=This definition does not include stem cells or lab-grown living organisms. These objects do not have a consciousness, so we do not presume them to be sentient in the way that animals are;

1.1.2.sec=If a conscious being is discovered that does not fit this definition of animal or new evidence suggests that a previously discovered being has consciousness, an ad-hoc mini-public will be called to consider amendments to this definition as organized by the governance standing mini-public;

1.1.=[G/Z/ol-AA/s2]

1.2.0.sec=Prior to making the conscious decision to bring animals to Mars, caretakers of such beings must register their actions with the executive body associated with the Environmental Policy standing mini-public. After registration, caretakers must receive approval from a sorted committee of Mars Logistical Life Planners, which will have been sorted by the first cohort of settlers prior to departure for Mars:

1.2.1.0.sec=The sorted Mars Logistical Life Planners committee will be decided through the following process:

1.2.1.1.sec=Subgroups of the initial Mars cohort set to travel will be created based on stratified sampling (see dimensions outlined in Section 1, Article 3),

1.2.1.2.sec=Of these subgroups, sortition will be used to select 10 representatives for the Mars Logistical Life Planners committee;

1.2.1.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

1.2.2.0.sec=The Mars Logistical Life Planners will approve of animal caretaker requests based on how necessary the beings are for the following purposes:

1.2.2.1.sec=Mutually beneficial companionship,

1.2.2.2.sec=Terraforming,

1.2.2.3.sec=Geoforming;

1.2.2.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

1.2.=[G/Z/ol-AA/s2]

1.3.0.sec=All animals will be afforded basic decency in terms of treatment. “Basic decency” includes but is not limited to the following:

1.3.1.sec=Minimizing needless suffering caused to animals;

1.3.2.sec=Affording animals basic necessities including food, water, and shelter.

1.3.=[G/Z/ol-AA/s2]

1.=[G/Z/ol-II/s3]

2.Ti=Article 2: Rights of Nature

2.1.sec=Nature is defined as the system of living and nonliving organisms which interact to create ecosystems. It is distinguished from people, and its rights ought to be distinct as well;

2.2.sec=Nature has intrinsic value beyond its purposes for human-kind and beyond property;

2.3.sec=Nature has the right to exist. This means that all Martian policy must respect the rights of Nature in addition to those of its other beings.
