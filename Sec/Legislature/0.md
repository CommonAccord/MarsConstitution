2.Ti=Article 2: Central Chamber

2.1.sec=The Central Chamber shall be composed of 1⁄5 (50 people) of the members from the standing mini-publics.

2.3.sec=The Central Chamber is responsible for evaluating the policy proposals sent by the single-issue chambers. When evaluating policies, the Central Chamber’s main goal is to ensure coherence between different chambers on policy issues (for example, a carbon tax policy may need to be consistent across an Economic and Environmental chamber). The Central Chamber must also ensure that all policy proposals passed fit into its yearly budget;

2.4.sec=The Central Chamber may determine if a policy created by a mini-public is out of its scope; that is to say, it is not inside the policy area it’s been assigned to;
